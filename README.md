# landing-page

This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is an example of a common landing page design used by many companies.
For this project, I will design a landing page for an imaginary dog service company (_A Place for Dogs_) that offers daycare, boarding, grooming, and training services. Using HTML and CSS, with a particular emphasis on Flexbox, this project will demonstrate my ability to create a practical webpage from scratch.
